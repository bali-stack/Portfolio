            <h4>Let's break it down...</h4>
    
            <p>The team was tasked to create a mobile user interface design from scratch as a part of a course project for "Interface Design, IAT334". My role within this project revolved heavily around designing user interfaces and conducting user research for the app domain. I assured all the elements were logical and consistently designed to provide a unique user experience. I was incharge of designing the screen UI for "discover, guided recipe, saved and profile sections". Alongside, constantly improving through constructive criticism from peers and collaborating with other designers to complete the app.

            <p>The first week of the project involved brainstorming for a domain and interviewing potential users who fit the target demographic for the app. Using the "crazy 8" ideation technique amongst the three group members, we quickly brainstormed 24 ideas from which the domain of "Cooking at home" intrigued us. The interviews gave an insight about the "Goals, Barriers and Activities" of our target demographic, resulting in the problem of "tight budgeted or busy full-time students/ workers, who cook at home to either save money, enjoy it as their hobby, or both". Here, I provided my ideation of combining the food delivery kit services and modern cook at home guided videos, resulting in an application which provides an easy step by step guide to cook new receipes from the ingredients available in your fridge.</p>

            <p>The following week involved in working with the feedback received from peers and course instructor, ton start ideating and creating some UI screens for the app. I encouraged the team to create a logical user flow of the potential ways a user could navigate within the app. This activity, brought out many creative ideas for the content, CTA buttons and layout for different elements. As a result, making sure our user flow is align with our research and qualitative data from our user persona's making it easy and unique to use for all types of user demographics. </p>

            <p>During the third week of the design process, the next step was to construct low-fidelity hand-drawn mockups for the desired screen UI of the App. Wherein, I and the other designer equally designed the low-fidelity screens. Later, for maintaining consistency and standards I re-drew all the sketches with the added elements from the feedback shared amongst the team members. The following, week after receiving another round of feedback, the team started designing medium-fidelity mockups with connotations of the potential usability and user interaction flows within the screens. Here, we designed two possible interaction path's for the instructor and peers to choose from. As a result, the team received good feedback for the second path, because of its easy and cognitively simple user flow. </p>

            <p>In the fifth week of the design process, we took the critique and feedback to design the final high-fidelity mockups for our App. Wherein, Both the designers divided the tasks equally to design all the necessary screens required. To ensure consistency and standards, I suggested creating a comprehensive style guide, for all the major required elements, such as fonts, colours, CTA: active and inactive states, and a demo screen. This assured that both of our designs were consistent and prevented us from wasting time to re-adjust elements again. Through, these final elements we exported them to "ProtoPie studio", a prototyping software, to further imitate all the interactions and prototype the entire App. Lastly, to wrap up the project, the video at the top of the page was created with a prompt of "Selling the App to a potential client". </p>
